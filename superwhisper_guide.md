### üî• Pro Tips

1. **App-Specific Profiles:**
   Create different profiles for different workflows:
   - "Coding" - single line off, technical vocabulary
   - "Chat" - single line on, natural language
   - "Commands" - adds semicolon at end

2. **Quick App Switching:**
   - Use Cmd+Tab to switch apps
   - Super Whisper follows focus automatically
   - No need to reconfigure between apps

3. **Voice Commands That Work Best:**
   - Be explicit: "Create a function that..." not just "function"
   - Pause briefly between thoughts
   - Say punctuation: "comma", "period", "new line"

4. **For Complex Commands:**
   Instead of: "Make a performance review"
   Say: "Create a comprehensive performance review for John Smith including productivity metrics comma collaboration scores comma and three development goals period"

## Testing Your Setup

### Test with Each App:

1. **Claude Test:**
   - Focus this window
   - Hold Cmd+Shift+Space
   - Say: "What are the best practices for multi-agent orchestration?"
   - Release and watch it type

2. **Terminal Test:**
   - Open Terminal
   - Type: `goose "`
   - Hold hotkey
   - Say: "analyze team productivity"
   - Release, then press Enter

3. **Cursor/Windsurf Test:**
   - Open editor
   - Press Cmd+K or open Cascade
   - Hold hotkey
   - Say: "Generate a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers"

## Troubleshooting

- **Nothing happens:** Check if app is in "Allowed Apps" list
- **Wrong text:** Adjust vocabulary in Replacements
- **Too slow:** Switch to "Fast" model for quick commands
- **Cuts off:** Increase silence threshold to 3-4 seconds
