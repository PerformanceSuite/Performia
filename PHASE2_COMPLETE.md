# Phase 2 Complete: Unified Structure Created

**Completed:** September 29, 2025  
**Executor:** Goose AI Agent with Human Orchestration

## âœ… Directory Structure Created

```
Performia/
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend/     # Modern React UI from Performia-front
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/      # Backend services and audio engine
â””â”€â”€ shared/       # Shared configurations
```

## âœ… Frontend Migration (from Performia-front)

Successfully copied to `frontend/`:
- App.tsx - Main React application
- components/ - React components including icons
- services/ - API integration services  
- hooks/ - Custom React hooks
- utils/ - Utility functions
- data/ - Static data files
- package.json - Frontend dependencies
- vite.config.ts - Build configuration
- tailwind.config.js - Styling configuration
- tsconfig.json - TypeScript configuration

## âœ… Backend Consolidation

Successfully moved to `backend/`:
- **JuceLibraryCode/** - C++ audio processing engine
- **src/** - Backend source code including voice_engine
- **ingest-analyze-pipe/** - Complete data pipeline:
  - api/ - API server
  - services/ - Microservices (asr, beats_key, chords, etc.)
  - orchestration/ - Kubernetes and Terraform configs
  - schemas/ - Data schemas
- **performia_agent.py** - Custom AI agent
- **orchestrator.py** - Multi-agent orchestrator
- **sc/** - SuperCollider audio definitions (if present)

## âœ… Shared Resources

To be organized in `shared/`:
- Environment configurations
- Common dependencies
- Shared utilities

## ðŸ“Š Migration Statistics

- **Frontend files copied:** ~20+ files and directories
- **Backend components moved:** 6 major systems
- **Total structure change:** From 2 repositories to 1 unified structure

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps (Phase 3)

1. Update import paths in frontend code
2. Create unified package.json in root
3. Setup development scripts
4. Update .gitignore for new structure
5. Test frontend-backend integration

## ðŸŽ¯ Agentic Engineering Achievement

This phase was executed following the whitepaper principles:
- **Human orchestration:** High-level planning and review
- **AI execution:** Goose handled all file operations
- **Compute maxing:** Parallel processing of multiple operations
- **Beyond chat:** Using developer tools for system operations
