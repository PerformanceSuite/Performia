# KB Warming & Heartbeat PR Review Checklist

## Code Quality

- [ ] All functions have proper docstrings
- [ ] Type hints used consistently
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities (path traversal, injection, etc.)
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Logging appropriate (no sensitive data logged)

## Architecture

- [ ] Follows existing project patterns
- [ ] Modular and maintainable design
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Thread-safe where necessary (heartbeat)

## Performance

- [ ] Warming reduces latency as expected (40-100x)
- [ ] Cache eviction strategy prevents memory bloat
- [ ] No blocking operations in critical paths
- [ ] Background heartbeat doesn't impact main thread

## Testing

- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- [ ] Tests cover happy path and edge cases
- [ ] Heartbeat tests validate thread safety
- [ ] Cache invalidation tests included
- [ ] Performance benchmark tests

## Documentation

- [ ] README or docs explain feature clearly
- [ ] API endpoints documented with examples
- [ ] Configuration options explained
- [ ] Migration guide from v1 included
- [ ] Troubleshooting section comprehensive

## Integration

- [ ] FastAPI integration working
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing API
- [ ] Backward compatible with v1
- [ ] Health endpoints accessible

## Deployment

- [ ] Startup script works correctly
- [ ] Systemd/PM2 examples provided
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Production-ready error handling

## Specific Concerns

- [ ] Heartbeat thread cleanup on shutdown
- [ ] Cache file permissions secure
- [ ] LRU eviction prevents unbounded growth
- [ ] Query normalization prevents duplicate cache keys
- [ ] Stats tracking accurate

## Performance Targets

- [ ] First query <100ms after warming
- [ ] Cached queries <10ms
- [ ] Cache hit rate >70%
- [ ] Initialization <2s
- [ ] Memory footprint <150MB
