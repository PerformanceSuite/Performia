## 🏗️ Architecture

**Backend:**
- Python 3.11 + FastAPI
- JUCE C++ audio engine (low-latency)
- Librosa, Demucs, Whisper (audio analysis)
- Endpoints: Upload, Song Map generation, stem delivery

**Frontend:**
- React 19 + TypeScript 5 + Vite 6
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Components: TeleprompterView, AudioPlayer, StemSelector, Full Chart, LibraryView

**Data Flow:**
```
Audio Upload → Backend Analysis → Song Map JSON → Frontend Adapter → Living Chart Display
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Running the App

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py
```
Runs on: http://localhost:8000

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Runs on: http://localhost:5001

### First-Time User Flow

1. Open http://localhost:5001
2. Demo song "Yesterday" loads automatically
3. Click Settings (gear icon) → Adjust font, transpose
4. Click Play → Watch syllables highlight
5. Upload your own song → Wait ~30s → Perform!

## 🎯 Focus Areas

### Current Sprint (Sprint 3)
**Theme:** Performance & Accessibility
**Dates:** Oct 8-21, 2025
**Goal:** 60fps rendering + full keyboard navigation + WCAG AA compliance

### Critical Path
1. Virtual scrolling for large songs
2. RequestAnimationFrame optimization
3. Keyboard shortcuts implementation
4. ARIA labels on all interactive elements
5. High contrast mode toggle

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

**Performance:**
- Frame rate drops on songs >10min (virtual scrolling coming Sprint 3)
- Settings changes can lag ~4s (optimization pending)

**Limitations:**
- Desktop only (mobile support Phase 2)
- Local storage only (cloud sync Phase 3)
- English lyrics only (multi-language future)
- **Section detection:** Currently using heuristics (SongPrep integration planned Sprint 4-5)
