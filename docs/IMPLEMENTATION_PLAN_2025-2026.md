## 🚀 Implementation Phases

## **PHASE 1: Q4 2025 (Oct-Dec) - "Validation & Prototypes"**

**Goal:** De-risk the 5 critical technology bets with working prototypes

---

### **Project 1.1: Streaming ASR Benchmark**

**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL (Living Chart dependency)

**Problem:**
- Living Chart requires syllable-level timing from live singing
- All ASR models trained on speech, not singing (performance gap confirmed)
- No vendor provides singing voice benchmarks

**Objective:**
Build quantitative comparison of 3 streaming ASR providers on singing voice.

**Deliverable:**
Technical report with WER (Word Error Rate) and timestamp accuracy data.

**Team:**
- 1x Backend Engineer (ASR integration)
- 1x Data Scientist (dataset curation)
- 1x QA (listening tests)

**Timeline:** 6 weeks (Oct 15 - Nov 30)

**Budget:**

- [ ] Calculate WER for each provider
- [ ] Measure timestamp jitter (syllable alignment accuracy)
- [ ] Latency distribution analysis
- [ ] Cost-per-hour comparison

**Week 6: Reporting & Decision**
- [ ] Technical report with quantitative data
- [ ] Recommendation: Which ASR provider for Living Chart?
- [ ] Identify gap: Does custom fine-tuning make business sense?

**Success Criteria:**
- WER < 10% on singing voice (acceptable for v1)
- Timestamp jitter < 100ms (syllable-level accuracy)
- Latency < 500ms (perceived as "real-time")

**Risk Mitigation:**
- **If all fail:** Plan B = fine-tune Whisper on proprietary dataset (2026 project)

---

### **Project 1.2: HS-TasNet Real-Time Separation Prototype**

**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH (Unlocks new feature class)

**Problem:**
- Current Demucs v4 is offline (30+ seconds per song)

**Week 7: Subjective Quality Testing**
- [ ] Internal listening tests (10 audio engineers/musicians)
- [ ] Compare: HS-TasNet (23ms) vs Demucs v4 (offline)
- [ ] Question: Is 5.55 dB SDR acceptable for live performance?
- [ ] Identify: Which genres/instruments suffer most?

**Week 8: Go/No-Go Decision**
- [ ] Technical report: latency, CPU usage, quality
- [ ] Recommendation: Production-ready or needs more R&D?
- [ ] If GO: Plan Q1 2026 production integration

- **If CPU too high:** GPU acceleration path (CUDA/Metal)

---

### **Project 1.3: Cmajor→WASM Feasibility Study**

**Priority:** 🟢 MEDIUM (Strategic, not blocking)

- [ ] Demo: WASM module running in browser (if successful)

**Success Criteria:**
- Native performance: Within 10% of hand-optimized C++
- WASM performance: Acceptable latency for non-critical path (e.g., effects, not analysis)
- Developer experience: Senior engineer rates "would use for production"

**Go/No-Go Decision:**
- **GO:** Plan 2026 gradual migration (new components in Cmajor)
- **WAIT:** Monitor ecosystem maturity, revisit in 12 months
- **SKIP:** Commit fully to C++/JUCE, explore alternative WASM strategies

## ⚠️ Risk Management

### **Risk 1: ByteDance Partnership Fails**

**Probability:** 40%
**Impact:** HIGH (blocks AI accompaniment flagship feature)

**Mitigation:**
- **Plan B:** Meta MusicGen (open-source)
  - Pro: No vendor dependency
  - Con: Not optimized for streaming (slower)
- **Plan C:** Build custom AR model
  - Timeline: +18 months
  - Budget: +$1M
  - Risk: Unproven (no guarantee of success)

**Contingency:** Start Plan B (MusicGen) in parallel (10% team allocation)

---

### **Risk 2: HS-TasNet Quality Insufficient**

**Probability:** 30%
**Impact:** MEDIUM (lose real-time stems, but Demucs v4 offline still works)

**Mitigation:**
- Hybrid approach: Demucs offline for high-quality, HS-TasNet for live
- Alternative models: Research other real-time separation (LASAFT, CrossNet-OpenUnmix)
- GPU acceleration: If CPU too slow, require GPU (CUDA/Metal)

**Contingency:** Maintain Demucs v4 pipeline as fallback

---

### **Risk 3: Singing ASR Gap Unsolvable**

**Probability:** 20%
**Impact:** HIGH (Living Chart accuracy at risk)

**Mitigation:**
- Hybrid approach: ASR + phonetic alignment (force-align to known lyrics)
- User correction: Manual syllable timing adjustment UI
- Alternative: Partner with Spotify/Genius for licensed lyric timing data

**Contingency:** Ship v1 with speech ASR, iterate based on user feedback

---

### **Risk 4: Cmajor Ecosystem Immaturity**

**Probability:** 50%
**Impact:** LOW (JUCE C++ is proven fallback)

**Mitigation:**
- Dual-track: Continue JUCE development, evaluate Cmajor in parallel
- Gradual adoption: New components in Cmajor, legacy in JUCE
- Community engagement: Contribute to Cmajor ecosystem (attract developers)

**Contingency:** Commit fully to JUCE, revisit Cmajor in 12-24 months

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics (OKRs)

## 📈 Market Impact Projection

### **Before (Offline Model):**
- Target: Home recording enthusiasts
- Use case: Practice/rehearsal only
- Competitive: Low (many karaoke apps exist)

### **After (Real-Time AI):**
- Target: Professional musicians + enthusiasts
- Use cases:
  - Live performance backing tracks
  - Recording session virtual band
  - Music education (adaptive accompaniment)
  - Accessibility (musicians with disabilities)
- Competitive: **HIGH** (first-mover in real-time AI ensemble)

### **Addressable Market:**
- **TAM:** $4B (global music software market)
- **SAM:** $800M (performance/practice software)
- **SOM (3-year):** $40M (5% market share)

### **Revenue Model:**
- **Freemium:** Free tier (limited AI minutes/month)
- **Pro:** $20/month (unlimited AI, offline mode, advanced features)
- **Enterprise:** $100/user/month (studios, schools)

**Projected ARR (Year 3):**
- 100,000 Pro users x $20/mo x 12 = $24M
- 500 Enterprise seats x $100/mo x 12 = $600k
- **Total:** $24.6M ARR
