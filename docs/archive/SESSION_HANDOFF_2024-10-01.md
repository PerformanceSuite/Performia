### 🔧 In Progress (Not Complete)

5. **Audio Playback Feature** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**
   - **Backend:** ✅ Audio endpoints created and working
     - GET /api/audio/{job_id}/original
     - GET /api/audio/{job_id}/stem/{stem_name}
   - **Frontend:** ⚠️ Code written but **NOT DISPLAYING IN UI**
     - AudioPlayer.tsx created
     - StemSelector.tsx created
     - TeleprompterView.tsx modified
     - Integration attempted but **audio player not visible**
   - **Issue:** User reports "I don't see an audio player"
   - **Status:** NEEDS DEBUGGING

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Critical Issues

1. **Audio Player Not Visible** 🔴 BLOCKER
   - Code is written and committed
   - Backend endpoints work
   - Frontend components exist
   - BUT: UI not displaying audio controls
   - **Root Cause:** Unknown - needs debugging
   - **Next Step:** Check browser console for errors, verify component mounting

2. **ASR Transcription Accuracy** 🟡
   - Whisper getting some words wrong
   - User's song: "how_can_i_stop-mix10.mp3"
   - **Solution:**
     - Add manual lyric editing UI
     - Upgrade to Whisper large-v3
     - Add spell-check post-processing

3. **Melody/Bass Import Error** ✅ FIXED
   - Original error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'`
   - Fixed import path in `backend/src/services/melody_bass/main.py`
   - Changed: `from src.services.common...` → `from services.common...`

### Nice-to-Have Features

4. **Capo/Tuning Detection** 📝 REQUESTED
   - User's song uses alternate tuning + capo
   - Chord detection shows actual frequencies (not what user played)
   - **Solution:** Add metadata input UI:
     - Capo position field
     - Tuning dropdown (Standard, Drop D, etc.)
     - Display both "Detected" and "You played" chords

5. **UI Improvements** 📝 REQUESTED
   - User reported "significant UI issues"
   - Specific issues not yet documented
   - **Next Step:** Get detailed feedback on what needs fixing

## 🚨 Critical Reminder

**AUDIO PLAYER NOT DISPLAYING** - This is the #1 priority for next session. Code is written but not visible in UI. Must debug before moving to other features.

---

## 📞 Questions for User (Next Session)

1. What specific UI issues are you seeing? (fonts, layout, colors, scrolling?)
2. Did you check browser console for errors when audio player should appear?
3. Should we prioritize fixing audio player or move to AI agent?
4. Do you want capo/tuning input, or is that lower priority?

---

**Session End Time:** [To be filled]
**Next Session:** Audio player debugging + continuation of implementation
**Status:** Code complete but audio player visibility issue needs resolution
