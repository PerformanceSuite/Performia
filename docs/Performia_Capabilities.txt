Performia: Complete Features & Capabilities
Vision
Performia is a professional AI-powered performance system that enables solo musicians to deliver full-band, visually-immersive concert experiences in both physical venues and virtual spaces. The system combines real-time musical AI, intelligent visual production, and performance-reactive avatars into a unified platform that scales from studio practice to stadium performance.

Bass Agent: Receives note sequences, rhythm patterns, walking lines
Keys Agent: Receives chord voicings, inversions, comping patterns
Guitar Agent: Receives strumming patterns, picking styles, chord shapes
Learning Optimization:
Pre-compute common patterns during cloud processing
Store learned patterns as reusable "knowledge"
Quick recall during live performance
Reduced computation during performance mode
