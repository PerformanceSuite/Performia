## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Constraints

**Focus Areas:**
- Prioritize **real-time feasibility** (can it work at 60fps, <20ms latency?)
- Emphasize **cross-platform** (Web > Desktop > VR, avoid lock-in)
- Consider **accessibility** from the start (not an afterthought)

**Date Requirement:**
- Focus ONLY on **2024-2025** technologies
- Deprioritize anything pre-2024 unless still state-of-the-art

**Practical Bias:**
- Prefer **working demos** over vaporware promises
- Favor **open-source** (or affordable licensing)
- Validate claims with **independent testing**

**Performance Standards:**
- **Visual:** 60fps minimum, 4K optional
- **Audio-Visual Sync:** <10ms discrepancy
- **Gesture/Voice Latency:** <50ms for natural feel
- **VR Motion-to-Photon:** <20ms (prevent sickness)

## üéØ Success Criteria

This research is successful if it identifies:

- **5+ visual technologies** that make AI musicians feel real (avatars, animation, rendering)
- **3+ novel interfaces** beyond keyboard/mouse (gesture, voice, BCI, haptics)
- **2+ multiplayer solutions** for low-latency jamming (<50ms)
- **1+ VR/AR platform** for immersive rehearsal spaces
- **10+ social features** that drive engagement and virality

**Bonus Points:**
- Find a **breakthrough visualization technique** (real-time AI art at 60fps?)
- Discover **accessible music tech** we can integrate (inclusive design)
- Identify **metaverse partnerships** (Roblox, Fortnite, VRChat music integration?)
- Uncover **hardware advancements** (new VR headsets, haptic devices)
