# Command Center (Moved)

⚠️ **This directory has been moved to a separate repository.**

Command Center is now maintained as a standalone project at:

**https://github.com/PerformanceSuite/CommandCenter**

---

## Why the Move?

Command Center is designed to work with **any GitHub repository**, not just Performia. By separating it:

- ✅ Easier to use across multiple projects
- ✅ Independent versioning and releases
- ✅ Clearer separation of concerns
- ✅ Simpler adoption for other teams

---

## Quick Start (New Location)

```bash
# Clone the standalone repo
git clone https://github.com/PerformanceSuite/CommandCenter.git
cd CommandCenter

# Setup and run
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
docker-compose up -d

# Access at http://localhost:3000
```
