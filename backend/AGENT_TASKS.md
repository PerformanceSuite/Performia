# Audio Pipeline Agent Tasks

## 🎯 Current Sprint: Song Map Pipeline Architecture Review

### Task 1: Pipeline Analysis ✅ START HERE
**Goal**: Understand current Song Map generation architecture and identify optimization opportunities

**Steps**:
1. Review existing services in `backend/src/services/`:
   - `asr/` - Automatic Speech Recognition
   - `beats_key/` - Beat and key detection
   - `chords/` - Chord analysis
   - `melody_bass/` - Melody extraction
   - `packager/` - Song Map assembly
   - `orchestrator/` - Pipeline coordination

2. Analyze:
   - Current processing flow
   - Dependencies between services
   - Parallelization opportunities
   - Bottlenecks
   - Missing error handling

3. Create analysis report: `backend/PIPELINE_ANALYSIS.md`

**Expected Output**:
- Current architecture diagram (text/ASCII)
- Processing time breakdown by service
- Parallelization opportunities
- Optimization recommendations
- Estimated time savings

---

### Task 2: Implement Quick Optimizations
Based on analysis, implement high-impact optimizations:
- Add async/await for parallel processing
- Optimize audio loading/caching
- Improve error handling

---

### Task 3: Performance Testing
- Benchmark current vs optimized pipeline
- Test with various audio file types
- Verify <30 second target for 3-min songs

## 📝 Notes for Agent

You have access to:
- Backend services codebase
- Agent definition: `.claude/agents/audio-pipeline-dev.md`
- Project context: `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Song Map schema: `backend/schemas/song_map.schema.json` (if it exists)

**Performance Targets**:
- <30 seconds per 3-minute song
- 95%+ beat detection accuracy
- 85%+ chord recognition accuracy
- ±10ms syllable timing precision

**Tech Stack**:
- Python 3.12
- Librosa for audio analysis
- FastAPI for services
- AsyncIO for concurrency

**Branch**: `feature/audio-pipeline-optimization`

Start with Task 1 - understand the architecture, then optimize!
