## 🔬 Top 5 Breakthrough Technologies

### 1. HS-TasNet: Real-Time Music Source Separation

**Paper:** "Real-Time Low-Latency Music Source Separation Using Hybrid Spectrogram-TasNet" (L-Acoustics, ICASSP Feb 2024)

**What It Is:**
- Hybrid architecture: time-domain (waveform) + frequency-domain (spectrogram)
- Designed explicitly for real-time, low-latency applications
- Uses LSTM for temporal modeling

**Performance:**
- **Latency:** 23ms (1024 samples @ 44.1kHz)
- **Quality:** 5.55 dB SDR (with augmented training data)
- **Comparison:** Demucs v4 = 9.0 dB SDR (but offline, 30+ seconds)

**Why It Matters for Performia:**
- Move from **offline pre-processing** → **live stem isolation**
- AI can listen to **isolated bass/drums** and adapt in real-time
- New features: mute/solo stems during live performance
- Shifts source separation from utility → core interactive feature

**Implementation:**
- **Effort:** High (research model, no production library)
- **Timeline:** Q4 2025 prototype, Q1-Q2 2026 production
- **Team:** Need C++ audio engineer + ML engineer

**Risks:**
- Quality trade-off: 5.55 dB may have audible artifacts
- Only validated on MusDB dataset (unknown genre coverage)
- CPU optimization challenge for consumer hardware

**Recommendation:** 🔬 **Experiment** - Build prototype immediately for internal listening tests

### 2. ByteDance Seed-Music: Streaming AI Accompaniment

**Announcement:** 2024-2025 (ByteDance Seed initiative)

**What It Is:**
- Unified framework with **auto-regressive (AR)** pipeline for music generation
- Explicitly designed for **"near real-time" streaming** applications
- Part of broader "Seed" ecosystem (Seed Realtime Voice, Seed LiveInterpret)

**Performance:**
- **Latency (inferred):** <1s for AR pipeline
- **Related tech:** Seed Realtime Voice = 700ms, Seed LiveInterpret 2.0 = 2-3s
- **Architecture:** Causal AR enables streaming (vs diffusion = batch only)

**Why It Matters for Performia:**
- Only commercial system **explicitly targeting real-time music interaction**
- Competitors (Suno, Stable Audio) focused on offline generation quality
- ByteDance's AR focus aligns perfectly with live accompaniment needs
- Additional capabilities: zero-shot singing voice conversion, note-level editing

**Implementation:**
- **Effort:** High (requires enterprise partnership with ByteDance/Volcano Engine)
- **Timeline:** Q4 2025 business development outreach, Q1 2026 technical preview
- **Access:** No public API as of Oct 2025

**Risks:**
- Black box technology (no open-source code)
- Vendor lock-in (single provider dependency)
- Geopolitical considerations (ByteDance = Chinese company)
- Unverified performance claims (need hands-on testing)

**Recommendation:** 📞 **Monitor & Engage** - Initiate partnership discussions immediately (top priority)

### 3. ONNX Runtime: Universal On-Device AI Deployment

**Technology:** Cross-platform ML inference engine (Microsoft-led, open-source)

**What It Is:**
- Universal deployment layer for ML models
- Train in PyTorch/TensorFlow → Export to ONNX → Run anywhere
- "Execution Providers" (EPs) for hardware-specific optimization

**Key Execution Providers:**
- **Core ML EP** - Apple Neural Engine (M4: 38 TOPS)
- **QNN EP** - Qualcomm Hexagon NPU
- **OpenVINO EP** - Intel CPUs/integrated NPUs
- **CUDA/TensorRT EP** - NVIDIA GPUs

**Performance:**
- **Latency:** <4ms per audio frame on mobile NPU
- **Use case:** Chord, beat, key detection run on-device (not cloud)
- **Benefits:** Zero network latency, offline-capable, privacy-preserving

**Why It Matters for Performia:**
- Achieve **sub-5ms inference** for core MIR tasks
- Eliminate cloud dependency (offline mode)
- Single ONNX model runs on Apple, Qualcomm, Intel hardware
- Avoid platform-specific code (Core ML, NNAPI, etc.)

**Implementation:**
- **Effort:** Medium (add ONNX export step + integrate C++ runtime)
- **Timeline:** Q4 2025 first ONNX models, Q1 2026 production deployment
- **Workflow:** PyTorch → ONNX → ONNX Runtime → NPU

**Risks:**
- Operator compatibility (not all PyTorch ops map to ONNX)
- Debugging complexity (model, export, or EP issue?)
- Performance tuning requires hardware-specific knowledge

**Recommendation:** ✅ **Adopt** - Industry standard, mature technology. Core of edge AI strategy.

### 4. Cmajor + WASM 2.0: Path to Browser-Based Performia

**Cmajor:** New audio DSP language by JUCE creator Julian Storer (2024-2025)

**What It Is:**
- Modern C-family language designed for audio DSP
- Compiles to: Native C++/JUCE, WebAssembly, or JIT for live coding
- Goal: Match C++ performance with simpler syntax

**WASM 2.0 (March 2025):**
- Added 128-bit SIMD instructions
- Near-native performance for parallelizable code
- Broad browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

**Combined Power:**
- Cmajor → optimized WASM bundle (via LLVM backend)
- WebGPU for ML inference (GPU compute shaders)
- WebAudio API for real-time audio I/O
- Result: **High-performance audio engine in browser**

**Why It Matters for Performia:**
- **Zero-install** version (runs in any modern browser)
- Massive market expansion (no desktop app download)
- Single codebase: desktop (JUCE) + web (WASM)
- Faster prototyping (Cmajor hot-reloading via JIT)

**Real-World Validation:**
- Native Instruments used Cmajor for Guitar Rig components
- LLVM backend ensures optimization quality

**Implementation:**
- **Effort:** Medium (new language, but C-family syntax)
- **Timeline:** Q4 2025 PoC (build one DSP module), 2027 full web app
- **Risk:** Smaller ecosystem than C++/JUCE (newer language)

**Risks:**
- Community maturity (fewer libraries, developers)
- Long-term support unknown (vs decades-old C++)
- Performance claims need validation on complex workloads

**Recommendation:** 🔬 **Experiment** - 2-week spike: build reverb/filter in Cmajor, compile to WASM, benchmark

### 5. Google Chirp 2 Streaming ASR: Real-Time Lyrics Transcription

**Technology:** Google Cloud Speech-to-Text v2 with streaming support (2024-2025)

**What It Is:**
- Second-generation "universal speech model" (multilingual)
- New `StreamingRecognize` API for real-time transcription
- Word-level timestamps for syllable synchronization

**Performance:**
- **Latency:** Not officially published (competitor AssemblyAI claims ~300ms)
- **Accuracy (speech):** High (Google's flagship ASR)
- **Accuracy (singing):** Unknown - no benchmarks exist

**Why It Matters for Performia:**
- **Living Chart** requires syllable-level timing from live singing
- Streaming API eliminates batch processing delays
- Word timestamps enable precise teleprompter highlighting

**Implementation:**
- **Effort:** Low (standard API integration with client libraries)
- **Timeline:** Q4 2025 benchmark testing
- **Workflow:** Audio chunks → WebSocket/gRPC → streaming transcripts

**Critical Risk: Singing Voice Gap**
- **SingVERSE benchmark (Sep 2025):** Speech models degrade on singing
- All ASR models trained on **speech**, not **singing voice**
- Pitch variations, vowel articulation differ fundamentally
- No vendor provides singing-specific WER benchmarks

**Alternatives to Evaluate:**
- AssemblyAI Universal-Streaming (300ms latency)
- OpenAI Whisper on Cloudflare Workers AI (turbo model)
- Custom fine-tuning on singing voice dataset

**Recommendation:** 🔬 **Experiment & Invest**
1. Benchmark Chirp 2 vs AssemblyAI vs Whisper on sung audio dataset (Q4 2025)
2. Fund research initiative to fine-tune Whisper on proprietary singing dataset (2026)
