```python
# Simplified diffusion model for music
class MusicDiffusionModel:
    def generate(self, text_prompt, steps=50):
        # Encode text
        text_embedding = self.text_encoder(text_prompt)

        # Start with noise
        audio_latent = torch.randn(latent_shape)

        # Iterative denoising
        for t in range(steps, 0, -1):
            noise_pred = self.unet(audio_latent, t, text_embedding)
            audio_latent = self.denoise_step(audio_latent, noise_pred, t)

        # Decode latent to audio
        audio_waveform = self.vae_decoder(audio_latent)
        return audio_waveform
