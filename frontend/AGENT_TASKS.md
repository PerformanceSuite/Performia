# Frontend Agent Tasks

## üéØ Current Sprint: Living Chart Performance Audit

### Task 1: Component Audit ‚úÖ START HERE
**Goal**: Identify performance bottlenecks in Living Chart

**Steps**:
1. Audit `frontend/src/components/LivingChart/` components
2. Check for:
   - Missing React.memo on components
   - Missing useMemo/useCallback optimizations
   - Unnecessary re-renders
   - Large bundle sizes
   - Inline function definitions in JSX

3. Create audit report: `frontend/PERFORMANCE_AUDIT.md`

**Expected Output**:
- List of components needing optimization
- Severity ratings (high/medium/low)
- Estimated impact of fixes
- Recommended approach for each issue

---

### Task 2: Implement Quick Wins
After audit, implement highest-impact optimizations:
- Add React.memo where needed
- Memoize expensive calculations
- Optimize re-render triggers

---

### Task 3: Performance Testing
- Benchmark before/after changes
- Verify 60fps target met
- Test with large song files
